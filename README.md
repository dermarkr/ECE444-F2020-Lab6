Part 3

Test Driven Development(TDD) is the practice of writing tests before the code then writing code code for those tests to pass.

Pros:

-Acts as on-going code documentation

-Can make code more modular as it is written to the tests

-Code maintainance and refactoring is easier as tests are pre-written to ensure it continues to work

-Encourages small steps

-Helps clarify requirements as you must figure out inputs and outputs before writing the code 

-Helps prevent mistakes and defects as they are caught by the testing 

-Helps with collaboration as other programmers can edit the code knowing that there's tests to fall back on should there alterations cause unexpected effects 

-Allows alterations to base functions as the test will inform you if behavior has changed 

Cons

-Causes slow initial development as test needs to be written before any code can be produced 

-test can be difficult to write 

-Can be carried to an extreme creating far too many tests 

-test set needs to be maintained which can be time consuming 

-challenging to learn and form a habit of doing 

-Requires everyone on the team to write their tests properly otherwise can create a false sense of security
